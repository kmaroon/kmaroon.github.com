		<p>After immigrating to New York from Germany to help his older brother with his dry goods store, 
		a man named Levi Strauss takes off for San Francisco to establish his own business.</p>
	 
	</div>
		
	
	<div id="infobox_1870">
		<p>Jacob Davis is sold white cotton duck fabric from Levi Strauss to make a pair of work trousers. 
		He also comes up with the idea to fasten copper rivets to the key stress points of the trousers.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div id="infobox_1872">
	<p>Levi and Jacob come together to discuss partnership between selling clothing reinforced with copper rivets. 
	They first use brown cotton duck, a bottom-weight fabric, to make work-pants, but later discover denim 
	is much more sturdy a material.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div id="infobox_1873">
	<p>Jacob Davis and Levi Stauss are granted the patent for "Improvement in Fastening Pocket Openings" #139121 
	and the modern jean is born. </p>
	</div>
	
	<div id="infobox_1900">
	<p>While denim production was still small scale and localized, a range of companies existed to support the demand. A demand
	driven by the growing American workforce. The iconic Levis 501 evolved with details such as a leather brand
	patch, a second rear pocket, and belt loops. 
	</div>
	
	<div id="infobox_1904">
	<p>Jeans shifted from workwear to fashion and entered into the American wardrobe. The iconic Levis 501 5-pocket jean began to
	become a staple in the clothing collections of most Americans.
	</div>
	
	
	
	<div id="infobox_1940">
	<p>The days of the Western in cinema fueled denim brands to focus their advertising on cowboys and the Wild West.
	Jeans were the symbol of this myth of the West and people wanted a piece of the romanticized wild lifestyle. Competition also 
	arose around this time between Levis and Lee Jeans.</p>
